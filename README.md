# Paladin

**Paladin** is an agentic AI framework for autonomous, long-horizon penetration testing. It is designed to perform continuous reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and triage across complex, real-world environments using structured reasoning, recursive task decomposition, and multi-agent coordination.

Paladin is a *reasoning-first* offensive security system. Rather than relying on brittle, single-loop agents, it integrates multi-agent supervision, explicit reasoning pipelines, memory management, and plan correction to operate at enterprise scale.

The project is inspired by recent research demonstrating that properly scaffolded AI agents can rival—and in some cases outperform—human penetration testers in live production environments.
